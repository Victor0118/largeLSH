\subsection*{Abstract}

Nearest neighbour algorithms are a popular class of algorithms in machine learning 
that has a wide range of applications. When the dimensionality of the data is 
small, data structures from computational geometry can be used  
for efficiently finding nearest neighbours. However, when the dimensionality of the 
data is large, the space requirement of these data structures hinder them from 
being used in practice. Today, many internet companies store high dimensional 
features for their business entities, and it is not reasonable to assume all the 
data are stored on the same machine. We explore the problem of approximate nearest 
neighbour search in a distributed setting, specifically looking at the 
effectiveness of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for this problem on high 
dimensional data. We find that \red{ipsum...}


\section{Introduction}

The problem of finding nearest neighbours has important applications in many areas. 
Finding the 
nearest neighbours means finding the nearest points to some reference point defined 
by some distance metric in some space. For example, e-Commerce websites might want 
to find the nearest neighbours of a product to recommend similar products to 
consumers for its recommender system, and financial institutions might want to find 
nearest neighbours of an account that performs fraudulent activities to identify 
similarly suspicious accounts. Some areas in computer science which the nearest 
neighbour problem is important include databases and data mining 
\cite{berkhin2006survey}, information retrieval \cite{croft2010search}, image and 
video databases \cite{faloutsos1994efficient,flickner1995query}, and machine 
learning \cite{weinberger2006distance}. \\

If the data set is of size $n$, and each data point is of dimension $d$, a naive 
approach would involve at looking at all the points in the entire data set and 
finding the nearest neighbours, a computation that has runtime of $\Theta(nd)$. 
Using data structures from computation geometry, we can reduce this to 
$\Theta(d\log(n))$, but the space complexity is $n^{O(d)}$, which is infeasible for 
high-dimensional data \cite{shalev2014understanding}. To avoid this ``curse of 
dimensionality", we can look toward approximate nearest neighbours, which is 
guaranteed to be within some distance bound of the true nearest neighbour 
(mathematically defined in next section). Some ways to tackle the approximate 
nearest neighbour problem include k-d trees, balltrees, and locality sensitive 
hashing (LSH) \cite{shakhnarovich2006nearest}. \\

Amidst the decreasing storage cost and the increasing popularization of cloud 
computing and big dat\textbf{a, }we can no longer assume that the high dimensional feature 
vectors of the data set can fit into the memory of one machine. For example, the 80 
million tiny images data set for object and scene recognition is 240 GB, far larger 
than the available memory of a usual computer \cite{torralba200880}. Many 
organizations also store their data in distributed file systems, such as the Hadoop 
Distributed File System (HDFS) \cite{shvachko2010hadoop}. MapReduce 
\cite{dean2008mapreduce} and Apache Spark \cite{zaharia2010spark} have become the 
de-facto distributed computation frameworks for massive parallel computation on 
large data sets \cite{suri2011counting}. \\

Given the importance of finding nearest neighbours and the proliferation of Spark, 
it makes sense to investigate the application of Spark to the approximate nearest 
neighbour (ANN) problem. Specifically, we focus on LSH using Spark, since LSH is an 
extremely simple method that can scale to high-dimensional data. LSH for Spark is 
an active area, since the LHS module only became available in Spark in December 
2016. 
\footnote{https://databricks.com/blog/2017/05/09/detecting-abuse-scale-locality-sensitive-hashing-uber-engineering.html}
  Previously it had to be implemented from scratch using the fundamental parallel 
  data processing constructs. We investigate the effect of parameters on the 
  accuracy versus running time tradeoff, the scalability of the Spark 
  implementation of LSH, and compare it to an open-source Spark spill tree 
  approach. \\


\section{Background and Related Work}

We first formally define the nearest neighbour problems.

\begin{definition}[Nearest Neighbour]
	
	Given a  point set $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot d}$, for any query point $q \in 
	\mathbb{R}^d$, return the $p \in P$ minimizing $\| p-q \|$, i.e. we wish to 
	find the point closest to $q$ by some metric.
	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$(1 + \epsilon)$-Approximate Nearest Neighbour]
	Given a  point set $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot d}$, for any query point $q \in 
	\mathbb{R}^d$, if $p \in P$ satisfies
	\[ \| p-q \| \leq (1+\epsilon)\| p^*-q \|  \]
	where $\epsilon > 0$ and $p^*$ is the closest nearest neighbour to $q$, then 
	$p$ is a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate nearest neighbour of $q$. 
	\cite{arya1994optimal}
\end{definition}

There are two main families of approaches for the approximate nearest neighbour 
problem \cite{fu2016efanna}. The first is based on tree-based approaches that use a 
hierarchical 
structure, such as k-d trees and its variants. However, k-d trees do not scale well 
when the number of dimensions increase. A high level sketch of how a k-d tree 
approach works is as follows. Each node of the tree splits its children into two 
halves, by a hyperplane perpendicular to a particular dimension. This is done 
recursively so in the leaf nodes we have the points themselves. Care is taken to 
help ensure that the split is roughly balanced. To find the nearest neighbours of a 
query point, we traverse down the tree, picking the side of the hyperplane the 
query point is on at each node. When we get to the leaf, we backtrack and find more 
candidates, and return the candidate whose distance is closest to the query point. 
When the dimension is large many nodes need to be searched 
\cite{silpa2008optimised}. \\

The second family of approaches is based on hashing, which includes methods such as 
LSH, spectral based hashing, and quantization \cite{wang2014hashing}. The main idea 
of hashing-based approaches is to hash points to buckets such that a bucket is 
likely to contain similar points with high probability. To boost recall, more 
buckets need to be examined, since two points could appear dissimilar under one 
hash 
function but similar under another function. Hashing can be used to map a point to 
a short code, or a sequence of bits. Not only can short codes be used as bucket 
identifiers to hold similar data points together, but also there is research on 
computing distance directly using the short code. \\

More recently, there is also work on building a KNN graph before querying. The main 
idea of the KNN graph is NN-expansion, the neighbours of a neighbour is also likely 
going to be similar. According to Fu and Cai in \cite{fu2016efanna}, ``[the 
graph construction techniques] are still not efficient enough in the context  of  
big data". To become more efficient, researchers resorted to approximate graph 
construction techniques. They first divide up the data into subsets, build the 
graph on each subset, and finally merge the subgraphs. However, there is no 
rigorous study on the error bound of using approximate KNN graphs compared to using 
exact KNN graphs. \\

In the era of big data, it is becoming more critical for nearest neighbour 
algorithms to scale to large high-dimensional data sets. Although one can store the 
data on disk and only load the data into memory as needed, Liu et al. argued that 
it is far too slow compared to having everything in memory despite the existence of 
smart paging algorithms \cite{liu2007clustering}. Aly et al. showed a method 
using distributed k-d trees for image retrieval on a data set of 100 million images 
running on 2048 machines based on MapReduce \cite{aly2011distributed}, whereas 
before large-scale 
image search could not scale past a few million images due to the limited memory of 
a single machine. They designate two types of machines, a root machine and many 
leaf machines. The root machine stores the top of the k-d tree while the leaf 
machines store the different branch of the tree. The root machine would forward the 
request to a subset of leaf machines at query time. Liu et al. implemented a 
parallel version of spill trees \cite{liu2007clustering}. A spill tree is a variant 
of a metric tree (class of tree data structures for indexing data in metric space). 
It is called a spill tree since left and right children can share objects, hence 
``spilling" over each other. The overlap region can capture the sense of 
approximity instead of being limited to exactness. The bigger the overlap region 
width the slower the algorithm, but better the accuracy. There exists an 
open-source Spark implementation of the parallel spill tree idea. 
\footnote{https://github.com/saurfang/spark-knn} \\

The most similar published work to our work include LSH At Large by Haghani et al. 
\cite{haghani2008lsh} and RankReduce by Stupar et al. \cite{stupar2010rankreduce}. 
Our work differs from LSH At Large since LSH At Large is designed for online 
querying over a Chord style peer-to-peer overlay network, while our work is focused 
on offline, batch workloads, and the nodes do not have to be in a P2P network. 
RankReduce implements LSH using Hadoop MapReduce, the precursor to Apache Spark. 
However, they do not compare their results to other ANN solutions (only the brute 
force solution), and also do not evaluate the horizontal scalability of their 
approach. Furthermore, Stupar et al. stated that ``we did not have a real compute 
cluster at hand for running the experiments, we simulate the execution in a large 
cluster by running the mappers and reducers sequentially on our small machine." In 
this work we compare our results to another ANN method, spill tree, on common 
datasets for ANN not evaluated by these related works and evaluate it 
on a real cluster deployed on Microsoft Azure.

\subsection{Locality Sensitive Hashing}
Locality-sensitive hashing (abbreviated LSH) is a method often used for answering approximate 
nearest neighbour queries in high-dimensional data sets. According to varity of the hash function 
design, LSH has many implementation. One of the most popular approach is random projection(RP). 
The basic idea of RP is to reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in Euclidean space and 
enlarge the probability of the closer points appearing in the same buckets during the projection 
process. Many approaches to implement this goal are detailed in \cite{wang2014hashing}.


\subsubsection{Random Projection into Hamming  Space}
\begin{definition}[Locality-sensitive]
	A hash function set $H = {h : S \rightarrow U}$ is called $(r_1, r_2, p_1, p_2)-$sensitive for certain distance measure $d(\cdot)$ if for any $v, q \in S$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if $d(v, q)<r_1$, then $Pr_H[h(v)=h(q)]\geq p_1$
		\item if $d(v, q)>r_2$, then $Pr_H[h(v)=h(q)]\leq p_2$		
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

From the definition we can see that the closer the points in the high dimensional space, the more 
probable the points are projected into the same hash bucket. 

Originally, LSH was designed to project data space into the Hamming space as follows:

\begin{align*}
g(v) &= h_{a_1, a_2, ..., a_K}(v)  \\
&= [\sign{(a_1\cdot v )}, \sign{(a_1\cdot v )}, ..., \sign{(a_K\cdot v )}]
\end{align*}

where $a_i, 1 \leq i \leq K$ is a random vector with the same length as $v$. Considering the hamming 
distance \cite{hamming1950error}, hash values $g(v)$ in each buckets should be the same, which 
means all the binary unit $\sign{(a_1\cdot v )}$ should be the same.  By increasing $K$, we decrease 
the false positive rate, since two dissimilar could happen to have the same hash values for a set of 
random vectors, but if we increase the number of random vectors, the increased discernibility 
decreases this likelihood. By increasing the number of hash functions $g(\cdot)$, we can increase the 
possibility of collision for points close to each other in original data space, thus decreasing the false 
negative rate. Under a set of random vectors, it is possible two points cannot be mapped to the same 
hash values - but the likehood they get mapped to the same hash values when we increase the number 
of sets of random vector increases.

\subsubsection{Random Projection into  Euclidean Space}

\begin{definition}[p-stable distribution]
	A distribution D is callled p-stable if there exists $p \geq 0$ such that for any n numbers $v_1, v_2,...,v_n$ and i.i.d. variables $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ with distribution D, the random variable $\sum_i{v_i X_i} $ and $ (\sum_i |v_i|^p)^{1/p}X$ have the same distribution.


\end{definition}
According to \cite{zolotarev1986one}, stable distribution exist for any $p \in (0, 2]$. In particular:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item a Cauchy distribution with density function $c(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, is 1-stable
	\item a Gaussian (normal) distribution with density function $g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}$, is 2-stable
\end{itemize}

First, we projects to a value on the real line. Next, we split line into equal-width segments of size r for 
buckets. Then we project the data point on the line. It is not hard to understand that the closer two 
points in the data space, the higher the probability that they project to the same segment. Through the 
discussion of p-stable distribution above, we know dot product can approximate the length of $\Vert 
v\Vert_p$. So the dot product keeps the property to hash into the same ``locality".

Datar et al. \cite{datar2004locality} proposes a hash function set that matches the criteria mentioned 
above:

\begin{align*}
g(v) = h_{a,b,w}(v) = \floor{\frac{(a\cdot v + b)}{w} }
\end{align*}

where $b \in (0, w)$ is a random number and $w$ is the length of line segment, or bucket length.

\subsubsection{LSH algorithm for k-Nearest Neighbor search for Classification}
For classification task, in order to ensure we get a high recall, 
that means, we wish to get as much true neighbors while allowing 
some less accurate points in the target bucket, we usually define 
$M$ different hash function $g(\cdot)$ and projects the training 
data to $M$ hash tables following:

\begin{align*}
g(v) = \left\{g_1(v), g_2(v), ..., g_M(v)\right\}
\end{align*}

In the query stage, we union the results 
collected from different hash tables. An illustration is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:topk-illustration}.

The psudocode of applying LSH-based KNN algorithm
for classification tasks can be viewed in Algorithm~\ref{algo:classification}, which is widely applied in 
various areas: 
image recognition \cite{lee1991handwritten}, text classification \cite{tan2006effective}, intrusion 
detection \cite{liao2002use}, missing value estimation \cite{acuna2004treatment},  etc.

\subsection{Distributed LSH through Spark}

In this section we will present several variations of how to implement distributed LSH using Spark. The 
first is a high level implementation but using Spark SQL. The second is a high level implementation that 
uses APIs that were very recently introduced in Spark 2.1 (December 2016). The 
third is a low level sketch of how to implement it using fundamental MapReduce operations using 
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), which is how one would go about it in Spark 1.x. \\

Regardless of which level of view we take, we observe that since the computation of hash functions for 
each input examples is independent of each other, they can be computed in parallel instead of in a 
serial manner. \\

The psudocode of our distributed KNN algorithm implementation can be viewed in Algorithm~\ref{knn}. In the 3-rd line, instead of iteratively going through each query, the batch-query is run on each cluster through the allocation of Apache Spark, which largely takes advantage of multiple node resource and avoid single node computing bottleneck. Similarly we also apply Apache Spark API on evaluation step in the 7-th line.
In the 6-th line, $findTopkByPartition()$ is a function transform the pair-wise similarity table to query-wise ranked table by similarity. Apache Spark also implements the per-query ranking job in a MapReduce style. 
 
The full Scala implementation can be 
found in texttt{SparkLSH.scala} in the source code. \\

\begin{algorithm}[h]
	\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
	\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
	\underline{Function largeLSH} $(H, Q, k, d)$\;
	\Input{Hash Table $H$, Query Data Set $Q$, Neighbor Number $k$, and distance threshold $d$}
	\Output{Prediction List of labels $L$}
	generate ID column for $H$ and $Q$ \\
	results $\leftarrow$ H.approxSimilarityJoin(Q)  \tcp*[f]{search the hash table and union the results 
	in MapReduce fashion} \\
	resultsThres $\leftarrow$ filter(results, $d$) \tcp*[f]{get rid of candidates far from the query points}\\
	resultsSelected $\leftarrow$ \texttt{SELECT trainID, testID, distance FROM resultsThres} \\
	resultsPartitioned $\leftarrow$  findTopkByPartition(resultsSelected, $k$) \\
	$L$ $\leftarrow$ resultsPartitioned.map(groundtruthVector Intersect predictionVector)
	
	return $L$\;
	\caption{Distributed LSH}
	\label{knn}
\end{algorithm}

As of December of last year, a new API was released to Spark that allows us to find approximate KNN 
at a higher level. The steps until and including step 3 in Algorithm~\ref{knn} are the same. However, 
after step 3, we can do the following instead, shown in pseudo-Scala code. Essentially, we can map 
each query example to a predicted class by calling a function called \texttt{approxNearestNeighbors} 
that is directly implemented in Spark. This function returns the k nearest neighbours based on the 
hash values of the query example's feature vector. We get the most frequent label out of the k nearest 
neighbours. However, there are some special considerations that need to be 
taken into account despite this simple-looking API. Since Spark does not allow nested distributed 
operations, the outer query set Q cannot be a RDD or DataFrame. Instead, we collect the query points 
in groups to the Spark cluster driver (instead of the whole set to avoid OutOfMemory errors), and do a 
Scala parallel map over the query set groups to take advantage the parallel collections built-in to the 
Scala language despite the fact we cannot use Spark's parallelism. 


\begin{figure}[t]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{rdd}
	\caption{Sketch illustration of implementing RP using RDD}
	\label{figure:rdd}
\end{figure}

We can also choose to implement LSH using low-level MapReduce and Spark constructs as in 
Figure~\ref{figure:rdd}. We map each example in to m different key-value pairs, where m is the number 
of hash tables. Each key-value pair contains the tuple of the signature of one particular hash table's 
value and the hash table index as key and the label as value. We aggregate them using 
\texttt{aggregateByKey} to group labels with the same key together. Note this is better than using 
\texttt{groupByKey} since it avoid cross-partition shuffles and also better than \texttt{reduceByKey} 
since it avoids creating a list for every key-value pair to facilitate monoid operations, thus cutting down 
object creation overhead. \\

In the query / prediction phase we hash a query point using the same set of hash tables and union 
together all the points in the training set that get hashed to the same buckets. We pick the closest 
points (k nearest neighbours) and return the most frequent label out of these labels in the nearest 
neighbours.

All of our code and result detail are publicly available in the Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Victor0118/largeLSH}}.  

\section{Experimental Setup}

In this section we describe the dataset, hardware, and parameters we used for our model performance 
and horizontal scalability experiments.

\subsection{Data}
The MNIST database\footnote{\url{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}}\cite{lecun1998gradient} of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples, which is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. Each image is in the shape of 28-by-28 so the whole training and testing sets are in shape $60,000 \times 784$ and $10,000 \times 784$. For the convenience of the spark data reading API, we download the MNIST data of libsvm format from \url{https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html}.
Many works have been tested with this training set and test 
set\cite{lecun1998gradient,ciresan2011flexible,jarrett2009best}.

SVHN\footnote{\url{http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/}}\cite{netzer2011reading} is a real-world color image dataset obtained from house numbers in Google
Street View images. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped 
32-by-32 digits), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (73,257 digit images for 
training and 26032 digits images for testing) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real 
world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). 

Note both this dataset and MNIST are stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

\subsection{Parameters}
\subsubsection{Hardware Configuration}

We use Microsoft Azure HDInsight to create Spark clusters to run our 
experiment. For the horizontal scalability experiment we use a cluster consisting 
of two A3 head nodes with 4 cores, 7 GB RAM, and 285 GB of disk space per node and 
two A4 worker nodes with 8 cores, 14 GB RAM, and 605 GB of disk space per node. The 
A-series nodes are general purpose nodes.  \\ 

For running the SVHN and SIFT dataset experiments, we opted for a more powerful 
cluster powered by two D12 v2 head nodes with 4 cores, 28 GB RAM, and 200 GB of 
disk space per node and two two D13 v2 worker nodes with 8 cores, 56 GB RAM, and 
400 GB of disk space per node. \\

\subsubsection{Parameters in Distributed LSH }

All parameters in our distributed LSH algorithm can be found in the following list:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bucket Length ($w$): determines the length of each line segment and is used to control the average size of hash buckets (and thus the number of buckets). The larger the $w$, the more possible to project close points into the same bucket, while a large $w$ also increase false positives points.
	\item Bias ($b$): controls the center of hash values and always is set to 0 in our experiment.
	\item Number of Hash Tables ($M$): is also the number of randomly generated lines in data space. Increasing $M$ will help get rid of the randomness effect because of RP. 
	\item Number of Nearest Neighbor ($k$): is a parameter for classification task if the kNN classifier is applied. We mainly tried $k \in \left\{1, 5, 9\right\}$ in our experiments to show the effect of $k$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

First we summarize the results of parameter tuning in Figure~\ref{figure:tuning}. Each 
point is labelled by a 3-tuple indicating the bucket length, number of hash tables, and number of 
nearest neighbours (k) out of which to take the most frequent label.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{param-tuning.png}
	\caption{Illustration of retrieving top k candidates for a query using LSH on the MNIST dataset}
	\label{figure:tuning}
\end{figure}

We observe that as the bucket length increases, the running time of predicting the labels of the query 
set also increases, but we get a boost in accuracy, although it gradually levels off. This is expected 
since increasing bucket length decreases the likelihood that two non-similar points will get mapped to 
the same hash value. We also observe that as the number of hash tables increases, the running time 
increases and the accuracy increases as well. This is expected since more hash tables can cover 
neighbours that are potentially missed by other hash tables. The best accuracy we can get with our 
approach using the parameters we tried was 94.99\% using a bucket length of 8, 5 hash tables, and 
1-NN. 
Note that more neighbours doesn't necessarily imply more accurate results. On the SVHN data we can 
only get an accuracy of 21.76\%. We expect to get better results with more parameter tuning. \\

We also ran the spill tree implementation mentioned earlier for approximate nearest neighbours and got 
96.99\% as our best accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 47.22\% on the SVHN dataset. We observe 
that the spill tree implementation yields superior accuracy and also lower running times than LSH. Spill 
trees do not require much parameter tuning and the model is quite robust (similar performance for 
different values of k), where as for LSH parameter tuning is required to get accurate results, although 
it can be argued that it gives us more flexible since we can choose the tradeoff between running time 
and accuracy. \\

Next, we investigate the horizontal scalability of LSH by checking its runtime as the number of cores 
vary, which is a function of the number of executors and cores per executor, shown in 
Figure~\ref{figure:scalability}. Whenever a Spark job is submitted, we need to specify the number of 
executors to use, the number of cores per executor, and the memory allocated per executor. One can 
think of executors as isolated containers that run a subset of tasks. We observe that as the total 
number of cores increase, the time it takes for classification decreases, as expected. However, we 
eventually get diminishing returns. We also note that more executors and fewer cores per executor is 
better than fewer executors and more core per executor (although data is shared within executor), 
when the total number of cores is fixed. This is shown by any two points on the same vertical line in 
Figure~\ref{figure:scalability}. More executors will get more RAM than otherwise, which might be an 
explanation for this (less contention for memory between cores in same executor). The authors of the 
spill tree implementation of KNN also noticed similar horizontal scalability patterns.

\section{Summary}

We explored the effectiveness of locality sensitive hashing using random projections for finding 
approximate nearest neighbours in high dimensional space and using it to do classification, on 
potentially large datasets. We find in our experiments that spill trees outperformed LSH in terms of 
both model performance (accuracy) and run time needed to attain the best accuracy, while at the same 
time requiring less parameters to tune. Both LSH and spill trees can horizontally scale. To the best of 
our knowledge, we are not aware of any exiting comparisons between spill trees and LSH for these 
kinds of tasks using a modern parallel data processing framework. Despite the fact the LSH doesn't 
perform as well as spill trees, there are still several selling points of LSH. Although having a large 
number of tunable parameter maybe frustrating, at the same time it offers more flexibility in terms of 
the accuracy vs. run time tradeoff. If we really needed some predictions with low latency while not 
caring about accuracy as much LSH gives us that flexibility. Furthermore, LSH is an elegant idea that is 
much simpler to understand on the conceptual level compared with spill trees and can serve as a good 
baseline for these kinds of tasks in the future over the brute-force method, which can be infeasible to 
compute.
